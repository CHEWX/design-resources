- [Kyle T. Webster](https://www.kylebrush.com/): best Photoshop brushes for drawing and adding small texture (though they are not of much use without a pressure-sensitive tablet)
- [RetroSupply](http://www.retrosupply.co/collections/brushes) Photoshop and Illustrator brushes for adding large (2000px) texture; recommended packs are RetroSupply 1 and 2 for PS, VectorFuzz for Illustrator
- [CreativeMarket](https://creativemarket.com/): huge marketplace for relatively high-quality design assets (including fonts and stock photos), great for when you need to recreate a specific style or work in a particular niche
- [YouWorkForThem](https://www.youworkforthem.com/graphics/): cool textures and “graphics”
