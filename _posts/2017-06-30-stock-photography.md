- [Stocksy](http://stocksy.com): [paid] high quality, stylish lifestyle paid stock photos (watermarked comps)
- [Masterfile](http://masterfile.com): [paid] stock photos, a little higher quality than iStock (unwatermarked hi-res comps with a registered account)
- [Women of Color in Tech](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wocintechchat/albums): [free] photos of women in color in tech settings since every other stock photo site fails at this hardcore
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): [free] the first of the hip and gorgeous free with no strings attached stock photo sites
- [Gratisography](http://gratisography.com/): [free] photos by one photographer requiring no attribution, most are weird but some are chill to save in a folder for later since theyâ€™re free
- [Magdeline](http://magdeleine.co/browse/): [free] similar to unsplash, some are licensed in public domain, some require Creative Commons attribution
- [Death to the Stock Photo](http://deathtothestockphoto.com/): [free/paid] new sets emailed weekly, premium plans available for more photos and unlimited access
